  Our project is an interactive (beta) version of the classic Monopoly Game.
  Our game currently supports gameplay with four players, with the current
  functionality allowing each player to roll a "dice" and then either choose to 
  purchase the properties that they land on if they are up for sale or 
  forcing them to pay "rent" when they land on another player's property. The 
  interface displays the game information by noting which properties each 
  player owns, their position on the board, and their Monopoly Money balance at 
  the end of each round.

  Standard visual I/O is supported.
